#  Titanic Survival Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival.  
The analysis includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using Python.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Target Variable:** `Survived`
- **Key Features:**
  - Passenger Class (`Pclass`)
  - Gender (`Sex`)
  - Age
  - Fare
  - Embarked Port

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Identified and handled missing values
- Removed unnecessary or less relevant columns
- Ensured data consistency

### 2️⃣ Univariate Analysis
- Analyzed individual feature distributions
- Studied variables like Age, Fare, Gender, and Passenger Class

### 3️⃣ Bivariate Analysis
- Survival vs Gender
- Survival vs Passenger Class
- Survival vs Age and Fare

### 4️⃣ Multivariate Analysis
- Correlation analysis between numerical features
- Combined feature impact on survival patterns

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate
- Passengers in higher classes (Pclass 1) were more likely to survive
- Fare showed a positive correlation with survival
- Lower-class male passengers had the lowest survival probability

---

## 📈 Visualizations
- Bar charts
- Histograms
- Box plots
- Correlation heatmaps

All visualizations are included in the Jupyter Notebook.

## ✅ Conclusion
The analysis highlights that **gender, passenger class, and fare** were the most influential features for survival.  
This project demonstrates practical skills in **data profiling, EDA, and data storytelling**, forming a solid base for predictive modeling.
